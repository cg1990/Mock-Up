	<h1>About</h1>
    P2Endure deploys the innovative “Comfort Eye” system developed by consortium partner UNIVPM.
  Comfort Eye is a low-cost sensing device (about €200 for the prototype version with off-the-shelf
  components), which allows real-time monitoring of indoor thermal comfort. It is based on a
  microcontroller and a set of sensors and embedded algorithms to derive PMV index for multiple
  subjects in different positions of the room.
  <h2>Advantage</h2>
  The advantages of Comfort Eye are non-invasive
  multipoint measurement, interoperability and ease of integration and installation. The technician
  installs the scanning system on the ceiling of the room and connects it to the control unit. The system
  scans continuously all the surfaces to measure their average temperatures and sends the results back to
  the control unit. The software developed in the control unit applies all the embedded algorithms and
  calculations in agreement with ISO standards to derive real-time PMV (and so the thermal sensation)
  of the user/s within the indoor environment and can provide these data as output (to other devices, BMS,
  etc.). The system is flexible, from both hardware and software side, so to allow the development of
  customized solutions for the different applications and scenarios.
  <h2>Performance</h2>
  The system is able to perform the measurements and send data to other devices through different communication
  protocols (e.g. Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, etc.). For example, the user can communicate with the tool through its
  smartphone and a simple graphical user interface (GUI) developed for mobile devices, or through customized
  dashboards connected with the data stored in a MySQL database. The device consists of 3 parts:
  - The IR scanning system, which has to be fixed on the ceiling of the room and allows the continuous
  measurement of surface temperatures;
  - The control unit, which manages the data flow between the sensors and from/to the user interface and performs
  the calculation of thermal comfort for multiple positions;
  - Additional Android device or PC (optional), with dedicated GUI, to communicate with the system (input
  management, data storing, historical data analysis etc.).
  For a long-time monitoring and remote control purposes, an SQL database connection has been developed. It
  allows the remote monitoring of the room conditions and the interaction with the system. This could allow the
  application of Comfort Eye in several contexts and scenarios, e.g. for a better microclimate control by means of
  BMSs and HVACs, without the need of a direct interaction between the systems.
  In summary, the embedded algorithms allow the provision of continuous maps or discretised distribution of thermal
  comfort index and mean radiant temperatures. The interaction with the common HVAC system or building
  management system can be done easily through TCP/IP, RS serial and other home automation protocols. On the

  other hand, the interaction with the user (the person standing in the room) and the technician can be done through
  an Android app via a Bluetooth connection.
